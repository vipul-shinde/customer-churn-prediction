<p align="center"> In this project, we are trying to predict the possibility of a customer churning by the end of next quater from a telecom company thus helping the company target and come up with offers for such customers.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Customer churn, is when someone chooses to stop using your products or services. In effect, it‚Äôs when a customer ceases to be a customer.

Customer churn is measured using customer churn rate. That‚Äôs the number of people who stopped being customers during a set period of time, such as a year, a month, or a financial quarter.

In this project, we have build a machine learning model that'll help the telecom company predict if there is chance that given customer is going to churn after the current quater. 

## üìä Dataset Overview <a name="data-overview"></a>

The dataset was downloaded from the <a href="https://community.ibm.com/accelerators/?context=analytics&query=telco%20churn&type=Data&product=Cognos%20Analytics">IBM Accelerator Catalog</a>. 

The Telco customer churn data contains information about a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service.

13. ```Streaming TV```: Indicates if the customer uses their Internet service to stream television programing from a third party provider: Yes, No. The company does not charge an additional fee for this service.

14. ```Streaming Movies```: Indicates if the customer uses their Internet service to stream movies from a third party provider: Yes, No. The company does not charge an additional fee for this service.

15. ```Contract```: Indicates the customer‚Äôs current contract type: Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year.

16. ```Paperless Billing```: Indicates if the customer has chosen paperless billing: Yes, No

17. ```Payment Method```: Indicates how the customer pays their bill: Bank Withdrawal, Credit Card, Mailed Check

18. ```Monthly Charge```: Indicates the customer‚Äôs current total monthly charge for all their services from the company.

19. ```Total Charges```: Indicates the customer‚Äôs total charges, calculated to the end of the quarter specified above.

20. ```Churn Label```: Yes = the customer left the company this quarter. No = the customer remained with the company. Directly related to Churn Value.

## üß† Model Building <a name="neural-network-model">

We implemented the following machine learning models for predicting the chances that a given customer will churn. 

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. K Nearest Neigbors Classifier
4. Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier

A Grid Search approach was used to fine tune the hyperparameters of RF, KNN and XGB classifiers after setting a baseline with the Logistic Regression model.

## üèÖ Model Evaluation <a name="model-evaluation">

Here are the model's performance on the unseen test dataset:

| **Model**                            | **Accuracy** | **Precision** | **Recall** | **f1-Score** | **ROC-AUC** |
|--------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression                  | 0.72         | 0.80          | 0.72       | 0.74         | 0.75        |
| Random Forest Classifier             | 0.73         | 0.80          | 0.73       | 0.75         | 0.76        |
| K Nearest Neighbors Classifier       | 0.78         | 0.78          | 0.78       | 0.78         | 0.72        |
| Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier | 0.79         | 0.78          | 0.79       | 0.78         | 0.70        |
